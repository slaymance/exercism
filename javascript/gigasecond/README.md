# Gigasecond

Given a moment, determine the moment that would be after a gigasecond
has passed.

A gigasecond is 10^9 (1,000,000,000) seconds.

It is possible to return a correct value for this exercise by mutating the solution function argument. Although there are legitimate use cases for mutating function arguments, this is usually undesirable, and in the case of this exercise, clearly unexpected. For this reason, the test suite has a test that fails in case the argument has been modified after the function execution.


## Setup

Go through the setup instructions for Javascript to install the necessary
dependencies:

[https://exercism.io/tracks/javascript/installation](https://exercism.io/tracks/javascript/installation)

## Requirements

Please `cd` into exercise directory before running all below commands.

Install assignment dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Making the test suite pass

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ npm test
```

In the test suites all tests but the first have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can enable the next one by changing `xtest` to
`test`.


## Submitting Solutions

Once you have a solution ready, you can submit it using:

```bash
exercism submit gigasecond.js
```

## Submitting Incomplete Solutions

It's possible to submit an incomplete solution so you can see how others have
completed the exercise.
