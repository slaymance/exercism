# Bank Account

Simulate a bank account supporting opening/closing, withdrawals, and deposits of money.

A bank account can be accessed in multiple ways. Clients can make
deposits and withdrawals using the internet, mobile phones, etc. Shops
can charge against the account.

It should be possible to close an account; operations against a closed
account must fail.
